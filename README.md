 Game : Escape it!
 Documentation:
1. HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN: Fork and clone this project, then move into the folder named escapeIt and run the executable named 'play'.
2.	Theme: You are an alien travelling in a low flying spaceship trying to safely explore Earth. The ships and network towers are the obstacles (If you are stuck by these obstacles you will have to play the same level when your next turn comes)
3.	Rules and Functionality:
a.	The first turn goes to player 1 who has to start from the bottom of the window
b.	After his turn is over, the second player must start playing
c.	Time taken to complete a round will be stored separately for each player and will be used for evaluation in case of draw
d.	The game doesnâ€™t end unless you choose to end it!
e.	In each level the speed of each ship increases by 0.5 units
f.	If a player successfully completes a level, he/she will have to play next level when his turn comes
g.	On crossing the brown partition, a player secures 5 points
h.	On crossing the blue partition, a player secures 10 points
i.	You lose 10 pts if your spaceship gets hit by a ship, 5 points if it gets hit by a network tower
j.	Last but not the least, if both players die with equal scores, then the player who dies faster wins the game!! Weird right, but this how I designed it and I hope youâ€™ll find it reasonable ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
